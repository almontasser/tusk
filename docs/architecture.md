# Architecture and decisions

This document describes how the editor fits together and why. Update it in the
same commit as the change it describes.

## Overview

The editor is a Tauri 2 app with two halves:

- The **frontend** (`src/`) is TypeScript without a UI framework. Monaco renders
  and edits the code.
- The **backend** (`src-tauri/`) is Rust. It does everything the webview can't:
  file access, file watching, and, in later milestones, running language
  servers, terminals, and `git`.

The frontend calls the backend with Tauri commands (`invoke`). The backend
pushes events to the frontend with Tauri events (`emit`).

## Planned components

| Component | Tool | Milestone |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PHP intelligence | Phpactor language server | 2 |
| Laravel intelligence | Laravel LSP (`laravel/lsp`) | 3 |
| Diagnostics and formatting | Mago and Larastan | 3 |
| Terminal | `xterm.js` and `portable-pty` | 4 |
| Git and pull requests | The `git` and `gh` command-line tools | 5 |
| Filament intelligence | A custom language server written in PHP | 6 |

The backend plans to run every language server as a child process and merge
their answers, so the frontend sees one language server. Milestone 2 builds
this multiplexer.

## Editor shell (milestone 1)

### File system

`src-tauri/src/fs.rs` exposes four commands:

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `read_dir` | Lists one folder, folders first, sorted by name without regard to case. Hides `.git` and `.DS_Store`. |
| `read_file` | Returns a file as UTF-8 text. |
| `write_file` | Replaces a file's contents. |
| `watch` | Watches a folder recursively and emits `fs-change` with the changed paths. |

### File tree

The tree loads each folder only when you expand it, so large folders such as
`vendor` and `node_modules` cost nothing until opened. The frontend keeps a map
from each rendered folder to its list element. When `fs-change` arrives, it
re-renders only the parent folders of the changed paths.

### Tabs and models

Each open file is one Monaco model with a `file://` URI. Monaco picks the
language from the file extension. Language servers identify documents by the
same URI, so milestone 2 needs no path translation.

A tab is dirty when the model's alternative version ID differs from the ID
recorded at the last save. Undoing back to the saved text clears the dirty mark.

### External changes

The frontend batches `fs-change` events for 150 ms. For each changed file that
is open and has no unsaved edits, it reloads the file from disk. It never
overwrites unsaved edits.

## Decision log

### 2026-09-24: Build on free language servers instead of writing one

Intelephense locks rename, find implementations, type hierarchy, inlay hints,
code actions, and code lens behind a paid licence. Phpactor (MIT) provides all
of them for free. Laravel LSP is first-party and MIT-licensed. Writing a PHP
language server from scratch would take years, so the editor only builds what
no free tool provides: Filament support.

If Phpactor is too slow on large projects, PHPantom (a Rust language server) can
replace it behind the same multiplexer.

### 2026-09-24: Tauri and Monaco instead of a native UI

You chose a fast desktop app over a pure native UI. Tauri keeps memory use low
because it uses the system webview. Monaco provides a mature editor and speaks
the same data model as the Language Server Protocol.

### 2026-09-24: No UI framework

The UI is a tree, a tab bar, and panels. Plain DOM code handles that in fewer
lines than a framework needs for setup. Revisit this if the panels in
milestones 4 and 5 become hard to maintain.

### 2026-09-24: Use the dialog plugin for confirmations

`window.confirm` is unreliable in WKWebView, so the app asks through
`@tauri-apps/plugin-dialog` instead.

### 2026-09-24: MCP bridge in debug builds only

`tauri-plugin-mcp-bridge` lets automated tools drive the app for testing. It
can run JavaScript in the webview, so it's compiled only into debug builds and
listens only on `127.0.0.1`.
